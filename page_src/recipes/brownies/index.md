# Brownies Recipe

Difficulty: Very easy

## Ingredients

- 100g all purpose flour
- 1g baking powder
- 4g salt
- 30g olive oil
- 115g unsalted butter (about 1 stick)
- 150g white sugar
- 50g dark brown sugar (do not use light brown)
- 100g milk chocolate chips
- 100g dark chocolate chips
- 50g dutch processed cocoa powder (substitute: 65g regular cocoa powder)
- 5g vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs

## Directions

**Dry Ingredients**

1. Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. Set aside for later.

**Dark Chocolate Chips**

1. Lay out the dark chocolate chips on a cutting board.
2. Chop them with a large knife. Aim to have every chip chopped in half at least once.
   
   Optionally, for more contrast in the brownie, sift out the very small pieces and dust with a strainer. Skip this if you want a smoother brownie.

**Brownies**

1. Put a small saucepan over low heat
2. Combine olive oil, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar.
3. Stir and wait for the butter to be fully melted. It will look very grainy or sandy.
4. Remove from the heat.
5. Immediately add in the milk chocolate chips and stir until melted.
6. Transfer to a medium size bowl.
7. Let cool for a few minutes. It should be warm but not hot.
8. Whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth and lump free.
9. Whisk in vanilla and eggs until fully combined.

    Overmixing will not happen at this stage. There is no gluten in the bowl. Mix as much as you need.

10. Let rest for 10 minutes.
11. Whisk again for 30-60 seconds.
12. Fold in the dry ingredients prepared earlier with a spatula. Be careful to not overmix.
13. Lightly mix in the dark chocolate chips until distributed evenly. This should not take much mixing.
14. Grease a brownie pan with pan spray. (I use an 8x11" glass pan)
15. Pour in the brownie batter.

    DO NOT spread the batter with a spatula. Spread and level it by firmly banging the pan on a countertop.

    If you're using a glass pan, I'd recommend putting down a tea towel or two to cushion it.

18. Preheat the oven to 350F (176C).
19. Bake for 35 minutes.

    Check that it's done using an instant read thermometer (it should read at least 202F/94C) or a cake tester.

20. Let cool for at least 60-90 minutes before cutting.
