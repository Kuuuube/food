# Cheese Bread

Difficulty: Low

## Ingredients

- 212g water
- 8g instant yeast
- 360g all purpose flour
- 25g sugar
- 8g salt
- 28g butter
- 57g shredded cheddar
- 113g shredded mozzarella (if you use fresh "wet" mozzarella, you will need less water)
- 18g grated percorino romano

## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients except water in a bowl and slowly add water while mixing.

2. Once it comes together into a shaggy ball, move to kneading the dough.

   Give it a decent amount of strength but note that this dough will likely not form a nice tight smooth ball no matter how much you knead it.

3. Cover and let rise for 45-60 minutes.

4. Grease a roughly 8.5x4.5" (21.5x11.5cm) loaf pan.

5. Form the dough into a log and place it into the loaf pan.

6. Cover and let rise for about 60 minutes.

7. Preheat the oven to 350F (176C).

8. Bake for 30-35 minutes.

9. Leave the loaf in the pan for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven.

10. Let cool on a rack before slicing.

## Notes

- I was unable to knead this dough in my stand mixer. You may have better luck but be prepared to knead this by hand.

- You can use different cheeses if you'd like. The source recipe uses cheddar, cottage cheese, and parmesan. Make sure to adjust the water if you use wetter or drier cheeses.

- Shredding and grating the cheese fresh from a block is much better than pre-shreeded or grated. Pre-shredded or grated cheese is typically less fresh, contains preservatives, and includes extra ingredients to avoid clumping and sticking.
