# English Muffin Bread

Difficulty: Very easy

## Ingredients

- 360g all-purpose flour
- 14g sugar
- 9g salt
- 1.5g baking soda
- 4g instant yeast
- 227g milk
- 57g water
- 25g olive oil
- (optional) cornmeal

## Directions

1. Mix milk, water, and olive oil in a separate bowl. Heat to 120-130F (48-54C).

    It should feel uncomfortably hot to the touch but not burning hot. Err on the side of too cold. If it's too hot, it will kill the yeast.
2. Mix all dry ingredients (except cornmeal).
3. Pour the heated liquids over the dry ingredients.
4. Mix until smooth (it will look more like a batter than a bread dough).
5. Heavily grease a roughly 8.5x4.5" (21.5x11.5cm) loaf pan.
6. (optional) Sprinkle cornmeal all over the inside of the loaf pan.
7. Pour the dough into the pan and cover until the dough has slightly crowned over the rim of the pan (45-60 minutes).
8. Bake at 400F (204C) for 22-27 minutes.
9. After removing the bread from the oven, wait 5 minutes before taking it out of the loaf pan.

## Notes

- If you toast this bread it will be like an english muffin. But it's also just good bread untoasted.
