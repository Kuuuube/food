# Cinnamon Swirl (Whole Wheat)

## Ingredients

**Starter:**
- 113g water
- 113g whole wheat flour
- A pinch or so of yeast

**Dough:**
- 10g yeast
- 113g milk
- 113g orange juice*
- 71g melted butter
- 9g salt
- 35g sugar
- 28g dry milk
- 46g dried potato flakes
- 312g whole wheat flour

*Use ≈28g less orange juice in summer (or in a humid environment), ≈28g more in winter (or in a dry climate).

**Filling:**
- 1 large egg
- 67g sugar
- 7g cinnamon
- 7.5 all purpose flour

## Directions

**Starter:**

1. Combine the water, flour, and yeast, stirring until the flour is evenly moistened.

2. Cover and let the starter rest overnight.

**Dough:**

1. Add the remaining dough ingredients to the starter in the bowl.

2. Mix and knead until you've made a cohesive dough. Due to being 100% whole wheat, it will not get entirely smooth.

3. Place the dough in a bowl and cover for about 90 minutes.

**Filling:**

1. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and flour in a separate bowl.

2. Beat the egg in a separate bowl.

3. Brush most of the egg onto the dough. Make sure to spread it evenly.

    Adding too much egg is better than adding too little. If you add too much you can add more of the sugar, cinnamon, and flour mixture.

4. Sprinkle the filling on. Cover the dough evenly and try to have the filling absorb all of the egg.

5. Gently roll up the dough into a log and pinch the ending seam to seal. Do not roll it super tight or you may push out the filling.

6. Place in a greased (a heavy amount of butter works great) 9" x 5" loaf pan.

    Try to get the dough to sit flat in the pan. You may need to squish in the sides.

7. Cover and let rise for about 90 minutes.

**Baking:**

1. Bake at 350F (176C) for 10 minutes.

2. Place tented aluminum foil over the bread and bake for 40-45 more minutes.

3. (Optional) While the bread is still hot, spread a thin amount of butter over the top.
