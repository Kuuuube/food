# Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread

Difficulty: Easy (dough knowledge helps but you will get good bread even with mistakes)

## Ingredients

- 227-255g water*
- 50g olive oil
- 85g honey
- 397g whole wheat flour
- 10g instant yeast
- 28g dry milk
- 8g salt

*Use more water in winter or in a dry climate

## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients stir to combine.
    If you are unsure how much water you need, start with the 227g and add more in tiny bits as needed.
2. Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes.
3. Knead until somewhat smooth. Around 7 minutes. It wont get as smooth as a other doughs due to being 100% whole wheat.
    If you don't knead enough, the bread will come out fine but it may have a worse texture.
4. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours.
5. Lightly oil your work surface.
6. Shape the dough into an 8" (20cm) log.
7. Place the log into a roughly 8.5x4.5" (21.5x11.5cm) loaf pan.
    If it doesn't fully sit on the bottom and makes a U shape, push the sides in and down until it fits.
8. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours.
9. Uncover and bake for 35-40 minutes at 350F (176C). After 20 minutes, tent some aluminum foil over the pan and continue baking for the remaining time.
10. (optional) After the bread is out of the oven and on a cooling rack, run a stick of butter over the top of the bread.

## Notes

- If you don't have a stand mixer and kneading for 7 minutes sounds like hell rather than a fun arm workout, try [this recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/no-knead-100-whole-wheat-bread-recipe) by King Arthur Baking. The texture is worse but it will save you from the kneading.
