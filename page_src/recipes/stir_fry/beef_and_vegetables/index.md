**Vegetables:**
- 225g (2 medium sized) sweet red bell peppers
- 75g (1.5 bunches) scallions, whites slices thinly, greens cut into 2" pieces

- 40g (9 cloves) garlic, roughly minced
- 350g (1-1.5 heads) of brocolli, cut into small pieces

## Directions

**Beef Marinade:**
1. Slice flank steak into three pieces along the grain. Then slice each piece against the grain into 0.25" (0.5cm) strips.
2. In a bowl, combine the beef with the marinade ingredients. Toss to coat then marinate for 10-15 minutes.

Mix wok sauce and prepare vegetables before starting any further steps.

**Frying the Beef:**
1. Heat peanut oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Wait for it to get hot.
2. Add in the beef and cook almost fully.
3. Move the beef to a bowl, removing the liquid.
4. Wipe out the pan. Letting it cool down slightly then adding some water can help.

**Stir Fry:**

The order of ingredients added will be: scallion whites -> mushrooms and brocolli -> red bell pepper -> garlic and ginger -> wok sauce -> beef -> scallion greens

1. Heat peanut oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add scallion whites and stir for about 1 minute.

6. Pour in the wok sauce and cook until slightly thickened.
