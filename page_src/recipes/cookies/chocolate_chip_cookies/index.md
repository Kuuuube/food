# Chocolate Chip Cookies

Difficulty: Very easy

## Ingredients

- 340g (2.25 cups) all purpose flour

- 4.5g (1 tsp) baking soda

- 2.5g (0.5 tsp) salt

- 221g (1 cup or 2 sticks) butter, softened

- 153g (0.75 cups) sugar

- 157g (0.75 cups packed) brown sugar

- 8.5g (2 tsp) vanilla extract

- 2 large eggs

- 365g (2 cups) semi sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. In a bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a second bowl, beat together butter, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract.

3. In the second bowl, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg.

4. Gradually add the first bowl to the second bowl, beating while adding it.

5. Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.

    If using a stand mixer, use the lowest speed. The chocolate chips don't need much mixing.

6. Preheat the oven to 350F (176C).

7. Put parchment paper on a baking sheet or tray.

8. Scoop into roughly 1.5" (3-4cm) balls. Space them out on the tray a bit more than the scoop size or they will merge together as they expand.

9. Bake for 8-10 minutes.

## Notes

- This dough gets very thick. A stand mixer is a huge help.

- I usually would highly recommend against using volumetric measurements and do not even include them in my recipes, but for these cookies there should be a wide enough margin for error for it to be okay.
